     *  \brief tree structure
     *
     *  This structure holds the backbone elements to access a server storage
     *  structure. It maintains a linked list of door structures that are used
     *  for specialised data access through the door module functions.
     *
     *  The structure is mainly responsible of maintaining the door structures
     *  linked list. This linked list is the first element to access for data
     *  query for a remote client. It is used as a search backbone to detect
     *  in which temporal storage structure to search the relevant data.
     *
     *  The maintained linked list provided a sorted, from the temporal point of
     *  view, of the active doors of a specific server implementation. Each door
     *  is responsible for the management of the data access on its dedicated
     *  temporal storage structure.
     *
     *  This module is also used as a front-end to client queries. The module
     *  function searches the relevant door structure before to broadcast the
     *  access request to the relevant door engaged in the linked list. From
     *  this point of view, this module is used by the functions of the server
     *  module to process the client queries.
     *
     *  The first field of the structure is used to store the last linked list
     *  update clock time. This allows the structure to know for how many time
     *  it has been kept un-updated. This allows to trigger the linked list
     *  update each given amount time. This procedure is set to simplify the
     *  communication between the thread to keep them synchronised, in terms of
     *  their view of the storage structure, when a thread inject new data.
     *  Doing so allows to avoid to setup a complicated communication system
     *  between the thread to keep track of newly injected data.
     *
     *  The three next field are a simple copy of the server configuration data
     *  for a given implementation. These data includes storage structure path,
     *  spatial and temporal configuration values.
     *
     *  The last field is a pointer to the first door structure engaged in the
     *  linked list hold by this switch structure. It is used to search along
     *  the active door to find the relevant one during client queries.
     *
     *  A last field is used by the structure creation methods to specified the
     *  creation status of the structure. This allows to creation methods to
     *  return the structure instead of an error code.
