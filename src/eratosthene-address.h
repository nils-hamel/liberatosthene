     *  \brief address structure (revoked)
     *
     *  This structure holds the address, or the index, of an equivalence class
     *  defined on the geodetic and time parameter spaces. These addresses are
     *  the central structure used to store and access the data of a server.
     *
     *  The structure holds two distinct times in order to allows comparison
     *  methods between different times to take place. In addition to the two
     *  time values, a temporal range value is also kept by the structure that
     *  defines the area around the two previous time that has to be considered
     *  mainly during data queries. These three values are stored in the array
     *  \b as_times of the structure.
     *
     *  The mode parameter stored in \b as_mode, is used to store the way time
     *  values have to be considered. The following convolution modes are
     *  available :
     *
     *      1 : first time only
     *      2 : second time only
     *      3 : first time (logical or) second time
     *      4 : first time (logical and) second time
     *      5 : first time (logical xor) second time
     *
     *  The convolution mode is stored on the four least significant bits of the
     *  \b as_mode byte. The four most significant bits are used to store the
     *  address query mode. Two modes are available :
     *
     *      0 : strict-near search
     *      1 : deep-data search
     *
     *  The first mode indicates that the closest equivalent class has to be
     *  considered, regardless of its content. The second mode indicates that
     *  the closest non-empty equivalence class has to be considered.
     *
     *  The proper spatial index of the pointed equivalence class is stored in
     *  the array \b as_digits holding its digits. The amount of active digits
     *  is provided by the \b as_size field.
     *
     *  In the last place the structure holds an depth parameter that gives,
     *  usually in case of data queries, the additional scale depth where the
     *  desired data have to be considered/gathered, the index itself giving
     *  the base equivalence class.
     *
     *  Times are understood under the UTC standard in the way they give the
     *  amount of seconds elapsed since EPOCH (UTC) with consideration of leap
     *  seconds.
     *
     *  As an example, the following address, written in its text form :
     *
     *      /3/950486422,-7258032000/864000/122010001340232/7
     *
     *  represents the data located in Venice in 2000 and in 1740. The first
     *  number correspond to the times comparison mode. The two times are given
     *  followed by the time range. The digits of the spatial address are then
     *  provided. The last number gives the additional depth where the desired
     *  data have to be searched.
     *
     *  \var le_address_struct::as_size
     *  Address number of digits
     *  \var le_address_struct::as_mode
     *  Times comparison mode
     *  \var le_address_struct::as_span
     *  Spatial index additional depth
     *  \var le_address_struct::as_times
     *  Array containing the address times and the temporal range
     *  \var le_address_struct::as_digit
     *  Array containing the address digits
