    /*! \struct le_door_struct
     *  \brief door structure (revoked)
     *
     *  This structure holds the required information and data for accessing
     *  the storage structure of a server time unit.
     *
     *  The two first fields store the path of the time unit and the length of
     *  the path itself.
     *
     *  The two next fields store a copy of the server space and time parameters
     *  in order for the structure to properly access the data.
     *
     *  The next field stores the time value of the time unit. The time unit
     *  is stored in its reduced form, that is the proper time divided by the
     *  value of the server time parameter.
     *
     *  The next two fields, an array and a size, are used to access mono-vertex
     *  related data in the storage structure. The array is used to store the
     *  stream descriptor opened toward the files of the storage structure. The
     *  amount of descriptors corresponds then to the amount of scale of the
     *  server, that is its space parameter value. The offset field coming after
     *  the array is used during data access to keep track of the offset, in a
     *  specific scale, of the data that have to be accessed.
     *
     *  The next three fields are similar than the previous one but for the case
     *  of poly-vertex access. In addition to the stream descriptors stack and
     *  tracking offset, poly-vertex have to maintain an additional descriptor
     *  toward the file containing the poly-vertex actual definition.
     *
     *  The two last field are used to create and maintain linked list. The two
     *  pointers are used to point at the previous and next door structure
     *  engaged in the linked list, NULL being used as a terminal signal, in
     *  both directions.
     *
     *  The storage structure of a door is structured into three directories :
     *
     *      /.../door_reduced_time/0
     *      /.../door_reduced_time/1
     *      /.../door_reduced_time/2
     *
     *  The directory 0 is used for the client data reception. Its role is to
     *  hold the dispatched mono and poly-vertex data chunks. The data are kept
     *  in small chunks named 10, 11, 12, ... for the mono-vertex and 20, 21,
     *  22, ... for the poly-vertex. The 0 directory is also used during chunks
     *  merge processes.
     *
     *  The tree structure for mono-vertex is created and hold in the directory
     *  1. This directory contains a binary file per scale engaged in the server
     *  configuration.
     *
     *  The tree structure for poly-vertex is created and hold in the directory
     *  2. This directory contains also a binary file per scale engaged in the
     *  server configuration.
     *
     *  To manage successive and distinct data injection processes into the same
     *  door structure, the results of the merging of the dispatched chunks are
     *  kept in the door main directory. The file is name 1_ for mono-vertex and
     *  2_ for poly-vertex. These files are kept to be able to merge them with
     *  the result of the incoming new data through successive injections to
     *  always keep a single sorted uv3 file containing all the injected data.
     *  This allows to use transverse injection processes in any cases, leading
     *  to mode efficient data management.
