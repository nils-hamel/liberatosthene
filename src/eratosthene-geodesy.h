     *
     *  This function allows to compute the optimal scale at which a poly-vertex
     *  primitive has to appear for the first time according to the size of the
     *  edge of the primitive.
     *
     *  The function starts by computing the cartesian length of the primitive
     *  edge from the geographical coordinates. Based on the computed edge
     *  length, the function determine the optimal scale at which the primitive
     *  should appear.
     *
     *  \param le_vertex Primitive vertex
     *  \param le_origin Primitive vertex
     *
     *  \return Returns the primitive optimal injection scale
