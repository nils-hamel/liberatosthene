     *  \brief server structure
     *
     *  This structure is the principal structure of the library as it holds the
     *  server main elements.
     *
     *  The server offers a 4D mapping service of the earth through storage,
     *  access and network broadcasting of colorimetric points and polygonal
     *  representations. Its storage structure, data injection and data query
     *  are driven by the formalism of spatiotemporal index. In other words, the
     *  server can be seen as a 4D tile server based on the theoretical
     *  framework of spatial index.
     *
     *  For the point based models, the spatial index are defining equivalence
     *  classes in which points are collected to create a natural multi-scale
     *  representation of the 4D earth. For polygonal models, these classes are
     *  used as container of links toward the relevant graphical primitives
     *  relevant to display at a given scale.
     *
     *  A server is then responsible of receiving data from client during
     *  injection, data broadcasting during client query, broadcasting of its
     *  main parameter through client specific query and the storage management
     *  of the data. This structure is then the heart allowing these operations
     *  to be fulfilled, with the help of the library sub-systems.
     *
     *  A first field is dedicated to store the server socket descriptor. As any
     *  server, an eratosthene server maintains a service on a given computer
     *  through a predefined port. This field store the socket descriptor set
     *  to listen to client connections.
     *
     *  Three fields are dedicated to the server configuration. The first one
     *  holds a characters array storing the main path of the storage structure.
     *  This path is used to access storage structure files. The two remaining
     *  configuration fields are used to store the space and time parameters,
     *  The space parameter gives the number of scale engaged in the storage
     *  structure. It follows that any space index used to access or store data
     *  has to contain less digit than this configuration value. The time value
     *  gives the size of the temporal equivalence classes. Both parameters fix
     *  the server resolution power in both space and time.
     *
     *  The last field is used during client connection management. As a client
     *  connects to the server, the socket descriptor is pushed using this field
     *  before to broadcast it to the client thread. The server is then creating
     *  a specific thread for each client connection. This thread is responsible
     *  of answering any type of query the client performs until the client
     *  disconnects.
     *
     *  As the server offers a 4D information system through the formalism of
     *  spatiotemporal index, one has to take into account geographic ranges
     *  allowed for indexation. For both longitude and latitude, the canonical
     *  ranges are considered (with coordinates always in radian) : [-pi,pi] and
     *  [-pi/2,pi/2]. A more specific range is considered for height values
     *  (with coordinates always in meter above WGS84 ellipsoid) : [-h,h] where
     *  h equal to \b LE_ADDRESS_MAXH (address module). Any element, in terms of
     *  its position coordinates, injected in the server has to be inside the
     *  defined ranges.
     *
     *  As mentioned, for point-based model, storage and access are driven by
     *  the spatio-temporal index. Any point-based element is assumed to be
     *  referenced in space and time according to the previous frame and ranges.
     *  Two groups of equivalence relations are then defined, one on the time
     *  range and the others on the spatial scales. The time relation simply
     *  establish homogeneous ranges along the time dimension collapsing all
     *  incoming data in within these range, making them indistinguishable from
     *  this point of view. The temporal parameter of the server then gives the
     *  size, in seconds of these temporal ranges.
     *
     *  For polygonal models, the same logic applies from the temporal point of
     *  view, collapsing all primitives within a time range in a single storage
     *  structure, making them linked from this point of view.
     *
     *  For point-based models, spatial scales are used to defined equivalence
     *  relation grouping the incoming points. The number of scales is given by
     *  the server spatial configuration parameter. As the index of the scale
     *  increase, the more equivalence classes are defined, increasing the power
     *  of resolution between the injected data. This allows to query low scale
     *  to get a general view of the earth structure while querying higher scale
     *  allows to see smaller structures with a much better resolution. On each
     *  scale, i being the index of the scale, 2 ^ i equivalences classes are
     *  defined homogeneously along each spatial dimension. The points position
     *  coordinates are used to determine in which class they belong for all the
     *  defined scale.
     *
     *  It follows, for point based models, that querying data is only a
     *  question of following the index digits to find the equivalence classes
     *  of the desired data. In other words, due to the storage structure, no
     *  search is performed, i.e. no comparison, to access the data. Gathering
     *  the desired data is only a question of an enumeration.
     *
     *  For polygonal models, the same equivalence relation are defined on the
     *  space scale in order to allow the same efficiency in data access. For
     *  such models, more complicated than simple points, the class are seen as
     *  container linking to the actual graphical primitives that defines the
     *  model to broadcast to the clients. The injection logic is to assign a
     *  graphical primitive to a specific class according to its first vertex
     *  position and to a specific scale looking at the size of the primitive.
     *  This allows to make primitive appearing during query according to their
     *  display relevance. Small primitives, showing a city detail for example,
     *  has no to be considered in case of a query for a general view of the
     *  earth.
     *
     *  The server then allows to consider any type of model, regardless of
     *  their weight, complexity or the scale at which they describe structures
     *  of the earth. The server allows to browse all these data in both space
     *  and time to offer a detailed and 4D representation of the earth and
     *  allowing to compare any kind of geographical data.
