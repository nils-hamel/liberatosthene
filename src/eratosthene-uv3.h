    /*! \brief mutator methods (implicit)
     *
     *  Note :
     *
     *  Implicit methods are similar to the detached methods in the way the
     *  subsequent structure is not explicitly defined. In this case, the
     *  structure is replaced by data implicitly provided in a specific format.
     *
     *  Note :
     *
     *  Both \b le_uv3_set_sort() and \b le_uv3_set_merge() implement a global
     *  merge-sort algorithm adapted to massive uv3 files.
     *
     *  This function implements a merge sort algorithm on uv3 data array. The
     *  comparison is made possible on three dimensional elements as the
     *  comparison function is made on the corresponding spatial index of each
     *  elements.
     *
     *  A few constraints have to be fulfilled concerning the input uv3 data
     *  array. In the first place the poly-vertex have to be specified in a
     *  single rows, with no other data between their vertex (such as mono
     *  vertex elements). The second constrain is that poly-vertex can not be
     *  truncated at the end of the uv3 data.
     *
     *  The function implements a primitive type agnostic merging process in the
     *  way mono-vertex and poly-vertex are not treated separately. In case of
     *  poly-vertex, the first vertex is considered as the relevant vertex for
     *  index-based comparison and sorting. The remaining vertex are ignored
     *  from the comparison point of view and the poly-vertex primitives are
     *  sorted as single blocs.
     *
     *  The result of the index-based merge-sort process is a uv3 data array,
     *  with the same size as the input uv3 data array, but containing mono and
     *  poly-vertex sorted from their spatial index point of view.
     *
     *  This function is usually used prior to data storage structure creation
     *  as data are injected in the server. This allows more efficient processes
     *  to take place and it also improves the efficiency with which data are
     *  accessed.
     *
     *  Two sizes are provided to the function that are the actual size, in
     *  bytes of the input uv3 chunk and the size of the memory allocation that
     *  holds the data. This allows to have larger memory allocation than the
     *  data it holds and having a function that always returns an array
     *  contained in a memory allocation that have the same size as the input
     *  one.
     *
     *  \param le_buffer Pointer to the first byte of the uv3 data
     *  \param le_size   Size of the uv3 data, in bytes
     *  \param le_memory Size of the uv3 data memory allocation, in bytes
     *  \param le_scfg   Server spatial configuration parameter
     *
     *  \return Returns a pointer to the resulting data or a NULL pointer

     *  Both \b le_uv3_set_sort() and \b le_uv3_set_merge() implement a global
     *  merge-sort algorithm adapted to massive uv3 files.
     *
     *  This function implements a merge sort algorithm at the level of large
     *  files. It implements the same merge sort algorithm as the function
     *  \b le_uv3_set_sort() but considering two files as input rather than
     *  a single memory buffer. In this way, it implements the continuation of
     *  the merge sort process of the previous function.
     *
     *  The function reads the two input files uv3 records and exports them in
     *  the output uv3 files respecting the comparison performed on the spatial
     *  index to obtain a unique sorted file from the two input files. It
     *  assumes then that the content of the two input files is already sorted,
     *  usually using the previous function.
     *
     *  Using this function and the \b le_uv3_set_sort() function allows to sort
     *  very large uv3 files, based on the spatial index comparison, without
     *  consuming large amount of memory.
     *
     *  \param le_pfile Path to the first uv3 file
