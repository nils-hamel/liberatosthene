    /*! \brief generic implicit class structure
     *
     *  Implicit class structures are used for both mono-vertex and poly-vertex
     *  storage strategy. They allows the management of the mono and poly-vertex
     *  class offset storage.
     *
     *  The main role of implicit class structure is to hold, write, read and
     *  give access to the management of the class offsets. They are implicitly
     *  constituted of a sequence of bytes storing the required information. It
     *  follows that these classes are not defined through a proper structure
     *  due to their simplicity, explaining why their are called implicit.
     *
     *  The byte structure of the class is architectures as follows :
     *
     *      [descriptor][offset_i]...[offset_j]
     *
     *  The class descriptor holds a bit pattern giving the content of the class
     *  itself. If the first bit is set to one, it indicates that the first link
     *  offset is active in the class. The second bit give the same information
     *  for the second offset. Doing so allows to only store the active offset,
     *  the other being implicitly assumed to be null (\b _LE_OFFS_NULL).
     *
     *  To access a class offset, the descriptor has to be read in the first
     *  place to determine if the offset is active. Depending of the content of
     *  the descriptor, optimised array are used to determine the position of
     *  the offset before to read it.
     *
     *  If an offset has to be set, the descriptor has to be read in the first
     *  place to determine if the offset is already active in the class. If not,
     *  the content of the class has to be modified to be able to insert the
     *  offset at the correct position. Again, optimised arrays are used for
     *  such operation.
     *
     *  The descriptor is stored on a single byte while the active offset values
     *  are coded on a number of byte given by the \b _LE_USE_OFFSET definition.
     *
     *  Considering such classes in common for both mono and poly-vertex allows
     *  to implement the same optimisation that will affect both storage
     *  strategy all at once. This also allows to avoid code redundancy as mono
     *  and poly-vertex works in the same way in term of managing the access
     *  offsets.
