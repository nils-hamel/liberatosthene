## liberatosthene

The _liberatosthene_ library implements an earth scale 4D tile server through space-time index formalism. Using the theoretical framework of the index, it implements a simple and reliable data storage and access. This allows the servers built using this library to perform data injection and query with high efficiency over the network.

From a theoretical point of view any kind of data, as referenced in space and time, can be considered through the index formalism. Currently, colours are considered as data. This allows server to broadcast large amount of point cloud over the network, toward large and multi scale 4D geographic information systems.

## Dependencies

The _liberatosthene_ comes with the following package dependencies (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) :

* build-essential

The code documentation is built using Doxygen.
